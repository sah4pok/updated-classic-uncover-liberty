[SkyGfx]

; IMPORTANT: everything after the first ';' in a line is IGNORED

; Changes that cannot be toggled:
; - Texture lookup falls back to generic.txd (required by Xbox map)
; - Player skins are set to use linear filtering


;; If you leave the value empty (e.g. texgenSwitch= ) or remove the line
;; the game code will not be touched. This might be useful should there
;; be incompatibilities with other mods. Even setting to 0 will most often
;; cause skygfx to hook the code so the setting can be toggled in game.

dontNag=0                     ; Set this to 1 to disable SkyGFX error messages

;; This is a color tweak in YCbCr space. You can use it to emulate how
;; an analog PS2/Xbox signal might be interpreted
YCbCrCorrection=1	; turns this on or off (default 0)

;; Curiosities
VCEnvFrame=1                   ; use the Vice City MatFX env map frame where the reflections depend on the camera with PC tex coord generation
